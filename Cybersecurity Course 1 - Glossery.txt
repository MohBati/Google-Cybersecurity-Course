Social Engineering: a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private info or valuables.


Common types of Social Engineering:
   1. Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

   2. Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

   3. USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.

   4. Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.


Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:
      1. Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power.

      2. Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics

      3. Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate

      4. Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply.

      5. Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.

      6. Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time.

      7. Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.
